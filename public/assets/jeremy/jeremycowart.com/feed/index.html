			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some friends and I had an art show the other night. It got the bug started in me and then I realized that my month of May is fairly open and flexible. Then I heard my friend Jon Acuff was starting a &#8220;30 Days of Hustle&#8221;, beginning May 1st. Did I need any more excuses to get going? Nope.</p>
<p>Let the games begin. Here is Day 1.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For whatever reason, I woke up today, needing to get this post off my chest.</p>
<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jc.jpg"><img src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jc.jpg" alt="" title="jc" width="600" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5751" /></a></p>
<p>The older I get, the more I realize who I really am&#8230; who God made me to be. Sometimes I think I&#8217;m a photographer. Sometimes I think I&#8217;m an artist. Sometimes an app developer. But in the end, I&#8217;m just a creator. (Wow, this is literally the first time I&#8217;ve ever said or written that statement.) At the risk of sounding completely arrogant, I just have way too many ideas. It sounds exciting but it&#8217;s far more paralyzing than it is exciting.</p>
<p>The ideas just <em>appear</em>. </p>
<p>I never ever <em>ever</em> sit down to &#8220;brainstorm&#8221;. I don&#8217;t do meetings. I don&#8217;t journal. I don&#8217;t set goals. I don&#8217;t even really think ahead for that matter. But the ideas just keep coming. They come when I&#8217;m driving, when I&#8217;m eating dinner with my family, in the middle of random conversations, while I&#8217;m working and listening to music. They just constantly appear.</p>
<p>You might know of a couple of these ideas I&#8217;ve had so far&#8230; <a href="http://www.help-portrait.com/">Help-Portrait</a> or <a href="http://okdothis.com/">OKDOTHIS</a>. I&#8217;m immensely proud of both of these ideas and I continue to focus and work on them both. They are both labors of love and I&#8217;m so honored to work alongside INCREDIBLE teams on both projects. </p>
<p>But there is more. Much more that I want to do and dream about daily.</p>
<p>I have app ideas. For 3 years I&#8217;ve had a great idea for a game/app that would compete with the likes of &#8220;Words with Friends&#8221;. People, especially teens, would have a blast with it. I&#8217;ve had an app idea for the church for 4 years that I think would bring church congregations together, quicker. For 4 years, I&#8217;ve had an app idea that would significantly help the E-Education market. People teaching people in a very unique mobile environment. For 2 years, I&#8217;ve had an idea for an interesting art museum/social network that hasn&#8217;t been done before. Then there&#8217;s that location scouting app idea that no one has done yet. Then there&#8217;s that app idea for parents to better gather memories, photos and video memories of their children. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got an idea for a physical product that would sell like hotcakes at every Target and Wal-Mart in America. And on QVC, etc. I&#8217;ve got ideas for lighting equipment that I&#8217;ve loosely approached lighting brands with. I&#8217;ve got a fun idea for a kids photography company/collective that I haven&#8217;t seen done before. (Might pursue this one soon.) I&#8217;ve got an idea for a film/documentary that seems like a no-brainer. I think it could inspire millions. </p>
<p>Recently I had an idea for a lighting technique that has never been done before. It&#8217;s never been done cause technology hasn&#8217;t allowed it to be done just yet. But the technology is there now. I recently tried this technique and it worked! My plan worked! But now I have to explore it further and actually start doing it and create a series of portraits with it. But it&#8217;s super, super complicated and requires tons of lights and a significant time in post-production. Just have to find the time. Sigh.</p>
<p>Last night I had an idea for a super fun Photography/Camping retreat/experience. Might attempt it this summer. Could be fun. I&#8217;m also dying to pursue an idea for an iPad Photography scrapbook/journal. I&#8217;ve done 4 books to date but none of them really feel like my first book. These digital scrapbooks would be uniquely me. I started to pursue it recently and got distracted. Imagine that.</p>
<p>I had an idea for a TV show&#8230; kind of combining the concepts of &#8220;Extreme Home Makeover&#8221; and &#8220;America&#8217;s Next Top Model&#8221; but for photography. I won&#8217;t divulge that idea completely but that would have been fun.</p>
<p>I once had an idea for a Twitter-based non-profit where people tweet needs and this organization connects the dots and fulfills those needs. I found out after tweeting the idea that an incredible company called <a href="http://beremedy.org/">BeRemedy</a> was already pursuing this idea. &#8220;Whew&#8221; I thought. &#8220;Glad someone is already running with that one.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are endless more ideas I could write about. I&#8217;m looking through my Evernote files now and realizing I don&#8217;t want to type the rest out. But the last and final idea I&#8217;ll mention is an idea I have for a hotel chain. Yep, a hotel chain.</p>
<p>I wake up and go to sleep, dreaming about this idea. I&#8217;ve had it for almost 2 years and I live in 100% excitement and 100% fear with it on a daily basis. But I truly, sincerely and humbly believe it could&#8230; change the world. I&#8217;ve shared it in limited capacity at conferences, etc. People have wept on the spot when hearing about it. Strangers have emailed me, saying they want to work for this hotel for the rest of their lives. Millionaires have told me they&#8217;re ready to invest. &#8220;This is what we&#8217;ve been looking for&#8221;, they say. </p>
<p>Sigh. &#8220;How does a little artsy guy like me build a freaking hotel chain???&#8221; It&#8217;s a question I ask myself daily. &#8220;God, if you&#8217;re giving me these ideas, can you provide the time, money and resources to do it?&#8221; That&#8217;s the dead honest question I find myself asking.</p>
<p>People that know me well, know that I am &#8220;spacey&#8221;&#8230; &#8220;special&#8221;&#8230; &#8220;A.D.D.&#8221; I drive the wrong direction all the time. I miss my own driveway. I once bought the same magazine twice in a row at the airport. I often struggle to focus on basic conversations. Growing up, I couldn&#8217;t listen in class so I didn&#8217;t make great grades. I&#8217;m a terrible listener and can&#8217;t remember anyone&#8217;s name to save my life. I do &#8220;stupid&#8221; things on a daily basis and fail miserably at simple, daily tasks. But it&#8217;s in those moments that I&#8217;m dreaming, plotting and&#8230;. inventing. The ideas haunt me daily. Each one feels like a baby that HAS to be born. And each day, I&#8217;m thinking about a different baby. But they all feel like they have to be born.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my ACTUAL babies are my focus. My work hours are very normal. I go home at 5pm every day to be a father and husband. My family is my life. And we&#8217;re <a href="https://purecharity.com/cowart">adopting</a> 2 more children so it&#8217;s about to get twice as crazy haha. But you see how this makes my normal working day even more interesting. I juggle all these ideas and running my business and being a husband/father simultaneously. I know you parents can relate to the chaos part of life. It is truly a beautiful chaos. </p>
<p>So don&#8217;t get me wrong. I am thankful. Immensely and insanely grateful beyond measure. I get to wake up, take my kids to school and drive to a creative office and do whatever I want to do. Work, play, create, dream, whatever. I am living the American dream. </p>
<p>But there is a constant, 24/7 &#8220;calling&#8221; from God to do more. He&#8217;s not done with me yet. </p>
<p>But the question is How? When? And with what money??</p>
<p>This is a blog post with lots of questions and no answers. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s just simply who I am today. I am a creator.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m excited to finally be able to show these images! I was recently asked by <a href="http://www.southernliving.com/general/behind-scenes-hayden-panettiere-video-00417000087040/">Southern Living Magazine</a> to shoot Hayden Panettiere for the cover of their Spring issue. This is a big deal because from what I understand, they have NEVER had a person on their cover. So this is a huge deal. For them, for Hayden and certainly for me. To say I was honored is an understatement. Hayden was truly a gem to work with. No &#8220;diva&#8221; personality&#8230; super laid-back, fun-loving and very sharp. This is the 2nd time I&#8217;ve worked with her and hoping not the last.</p>
<p>Also, if you&#8217;re interested in seeing a behind-the-scenes video of our shoot, you can do so <a href="http://www.southernliving.com/general/behind-scenes-hayden-panettiere-video-00417000087040/">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve decided to start photographing children. At least as a temporary experiment/series. Not the traditional &#8220;say cheese&#8221; kind of stuff, but more editorial, like I&#8217;d approach any other shoot. After thinking more about it, I&#8217;ve realized how intriguing this is for a long list of reasons:</p>
<p>• No hair/makeup needed</p>
<p>• No 8-12 hour shoots. 1 hour and I&#8217;m out.</p>
<p>• No entourages or difficult publicists/management</p>
<p>• No 60-90 day payment plans like most clients</p>
<p>• No retouching necessary</p>
<p>• No waiting for 6-9 months before showing the finished, published pieces. I can release art whenever I want.</p>
<p>• No deep insecurities like most adults have</p>
<p>The list goes on but you get the idea. It starts to sound like heaven.<br />
Just me, my gear and kids. I can do this.</p>
<p>So here it is&#8230; my first day of giving this a legitimate attempt.</p>
<p>The following are from 2 different shoots at friends houses. Both shoots were done on the same day.. an hour at each house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/haves2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5612" title="haves2" src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/haves2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="251" /></a></p>
<p>I recently got asked to shoot photos for a show called &#8220;<a href="http://www.oprah.com/own-the-haves-and-have-nots/the-haves-and-the-have-nots.html" target="_blank">The Haves and HaveNots</a>&#8221; for the Oprah Winfrey Network. I&#8217;ve shot many shows in my career and I always enjoy these shoots because there are so many challenges involved. There&#8217;s tons of &#8220;talent&#8221; aka celebrities involved, all their teams, all the hair, makeup and wardrobe involved, there&#8217;s very limited time, there are tons of shots to create, there&#8217;s an immense pressure to &#8220;nail&#8221; the creative concept and obviously there is usually lots of money involved. These are high budget, high-pressure shoots. It&#8217;s diving into the deep end for sure, as far as photography is concerned. And I love that challenge. I love stepping up to the plate and going for the homerun.</p>
<p>But one of the things I DON&#8217;T love about these shoots is that I never really get to connect with the people I&#8217;m shooting. They&#8217;re in and out in minutes. Sometimes I literally am only able to take a few pictures before they&#8217;re wisked away.</p>
<p>This is one of those VERY few rare occasions where I was able to connect. And I have my subject to thank for allowing me into his story.</p>
<p>One of the cast members was John Schneider. You might know him from his work on &#8220;Dukes of Hazard&#8221; or &#8220;Smallville&#8221;. John was one of my many subjects that day and like the rest of the cast, he was extremely professional, humble and a lot of fun to work with. He was killing his portraits&#8230; smiling, goofing off and he even threw in several impressions of famous actors and presidents. I was very impressed by his talent and good-natured humor. You can see some of those portraits below.</p>
<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/03_32684_002_01101.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5627" title="03_32684_002_0110" src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/03_32684_002_01101.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="782" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/04_32684_002_01201.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5628" title="04_32684_002_0120" src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/04_32684_002_01201.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="658" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/06_32684_002_01301.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5629" title="06_32684_002_0130" src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/06_32684_002_01301.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="798" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/08_32684_002_01401.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5630" title="08_32684_002_0140" src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/08_32684_002_01401.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="809" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/09_32684_002_01781.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5631" title="09_32684_002_0178" src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/09_32684_002_01781.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="823" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Towards the end of his session, we brought in the lead cast member, Tika Sumpter,  to interact with. They were dancing, laughing and having a great time. Again, I was very impressed by his ability to light up the camera and have a good time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/12_32684_015_14281.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5632" title="12_32684_015_1428" src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/12_32684_015_14281.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we wrapped up his session, Tika walked off set and John came to me and whispered in my ear &#8220;Hey can you sneak a few more portraits of me?&#8221; and I said &#8220;sure of course&#8221;. He said &#8220;there&#8217;s something going on and I just need a photo.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I grabbed my camera again and John walked back on set.</p>
<p>He immediately began weeping. Legitimately crying. He was so good at impressions that I thought this was another impression and I thought &#8220;wow, what an acting talent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/14_32684_015_14631.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5633" title="14_32684_015_1463" src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/14_32684_015_14631.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="751" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/13_32684_015_1459.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5635" title="13_32684_015_1459" src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/13_32684_015_1459.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="795" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then after a couple of frames, I could tell that this wasn&#8217;t an act. He was really somewhere else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/15_32684_015_14641.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5640" title="15_32684_015_1464" src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/15_32684_015_14641.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="813" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/16_32684_015_14651.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5637" title="16_32684_015_1465" src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/16_32684_015_14651.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="755" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/17_32684_015_14661.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5638" title="17_32684_015_1466" src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/17_32684_015_14661.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="754" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I put my camera down. This was too real. It didn&#8217;t feel right to keep shooting.</p>
<p>So I walked up to him and hugged him.</p>
<p>He whispered in my ear &#8220;My Dad died about an hour ago. I found out during our lunch break. And I wanted you to capture that for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he walked up to my screen, looked at the portraits and pointed to the last one (seen above, last) and said &#8220;That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s my Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221; I said. I was stunned. Shocked. And deeply moved, obviously.<br />
I didn&#8217;t want to ask any further questions out of respect.</p>
<p>John took off shortly thereafter to go back home to plan the next steps with his family.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve since received official permission from John to share this story and these portraits with you. I will never forget this moment. And I want to thank John for inviting me into his story, even just for a moment and for allowing me to capture this for him.</p>
<p>As a father myself, I wept for him. We all did that day.</p>

<p>Photoshoots are kind of like cars.<br />
Photographers are kind of like car dealerships.</p>
<p>People often want me to take their photos for cheap, thinking it will look like the expensive photos I take.</p>
<p>They think I just sell cars and that all cars are the same.</p>
<p>But sometimes I sell Ferrarris and sometimes I sell Hondas.</p>
<p>My ferrari has room in the budget for:</p>
<p>• Me, my eye, my time, my talent<br />
• My gear and equipment<br />
• A talented hair/makeup artist<br />
• A talented wardrobe stylist<br />
• Tons of amazing wardrobe<br />
• Props to build sets along with a talented prop stylist<br />
• Catering to keep my subjects happy<br />
• An awesome team of assistants to make things move smoothly and efficiently<br />
• Extra rental gear. Lots and lots of fancy lights and crap<br />
• A digital tech to run computers, tethering, backing up files, etc.<br />
• Location, location fees, insurance, permits, etc.<br />
• A producer to handle and manage all production and logistics<br />
• A retoucher to “finish” the images… skin, color, hair, etc.<br />
• a fancy web gallery to see everything<br />
• There can be more but you get the idea</p>
<p>My honda has room in the budget for:</p>
<p>• Me, my eye, my time, my talent<br />
• My gear and equipment<br />
• Maybe one assistant<br />
• That’s about it.</p>
<p>Of course I sell cars in between too. There’s a full range of cars.</p>
<p>But next time you have the budget for a beat-up Honda, don’t think it’s going to look like a Ferrari.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DSCF0919.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5690" title="DSCF0919" src="http://jeremycowart.com/new-blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DSCF0919.png" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Everyone is a photographer these days.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>There is one reason but people think there are more reasons such as:</p>
<p>* Gear is so cheap these days<br />
• Digital has made everything easier<br />
• There are so many apps now<br />
• Everyone has a nice mobile camera in their hands<br />
• Software is cheap<br />
• Education and learning is free<br />
• Nothing is sacred anymore. There are no longer secrets.<br />
• New photographers are hungry and will shoot for free.</p>
<p>The complaints go for miles. I hear them every day.</p>
<p>While some of these complaints are valid and true, I think there is one real reason why there are so many photographers these days:</p>
<p>People want to be liked. I want to be liked and you want to be liked.</p>
<p>But people have boring jobs or jobs that they&#8217;re not passionate about.</p>
<p>Waiters and waitresses, banktellers, doctors, pharmaceutical salespeople, teachers, even musicians&#8230;</p>
<p>I have friends with all of the above job descriptions who would rather be photographers.</p>
<p>Some of them make far more money than photographers.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the deal?</p>
<p>No one tells them &#8220;You really killed it today, waiting those tables.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one gets 1,000 likes for teaching a kindergarten class.</p>
<p>No doctor gets over 300 likes when he saves a life.</p>
<p>Sure, we all know that saving a life is more important than photography and teaching is an incredible profession.</p>
<p>But those doctors and teachers and waiters are just like you and me. They want to be known, seen and heard.</p>
<p>People come home from their jobs, post a photo to Instagram or Flickr and get validation by everyone. &#8220;Epic.&#8221; or &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a great eye!&#8221; or &#8220;You should really take this more seriously&#8221; or &#8220;OMG AMAZING!!!!&#8221; or an endless series of complimentary hashtags. On top of that, all our friends see those compliments. It&#8217;s the most uplifting ego boost possible, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Being a photographer is the new &#8220;rockstar&#8221; in an online, visual culture.</p>
<p>But do they get these compliments from their other jobs? Nope.</p>
<p>So they come home and buy a camera. They put the word &#8220;Photographer&#8221; on their Twitter bio. The first wedding comes along and now they&#8217;re officially a photographer.</p>
<p>The photo industry mocks and moans.</p>
<p>I say &#8220;Welcome. You&#8217;re just like me. I love photography and I too, want my voice to be heard and my images to be seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re all in this together. Enough with the complaining.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was the beginning of a new journey for me&#8230; new style of teaching, new style of personal work and maybe a new beginning, who knows.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never had more fun shooting and creating. I felt like I was a 5-year old playing in a big box of crayons all day. It was extremely creatively fulfilling.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently found out that a couple good friends were getting married. I didn&#8217;t even know at the time that they knew each other! It was a very pleasant surprise. I was so thrilled to hear they were getting married that I said &#8220;I want to shoot your wedding.&#8221; Granted, I don&#8217;t shoot weddings but this was one I wanted to be a part of. I knew it would be beautiful. Below are the results. I edited all of these with the new <a href="http://jcopho.to/vsco" target="_blank">VSCOFilm 03</a>. If you haven&#8217;t checked out these lightroom presets yet, you DEFINITELY need to. They&#8217;re so fun to use and really beautiful.</p>
<p>A few details if any of you are curious. These were all shot at the same location and in the same big, giant room. I brought my own 2 backdrops to use for a few of the photos. But everything else was just utilizing what was already in the room&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently had the chance to shoot this ad for the beloved show &#8220;Overhaulin&#8217;&#8221;. In general, I absolutely love TV gigs. There&#8217;s always an enormous amount of pressure and you always get to meet fascinating people in completely different fields. I know absolutely nothing about cars but I truly related to Chip Foose as an artist. The way he talked about designing cars all sounded very familiar. The man is an absolute genius. I also had a blast with Chris and Jessi. We shot some old-school pinup style shots of Jessi that are by far my favorite images from the shoot. Sadly, they haven&#8217;t been released yet so I can&#8217;t show them. Hopefully soon though. This whole crew was really laid back and very easy and fun to work with. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some random thoughts on the image&#8230;</p>
<p>We had a hose nearby to keep the ground wet. The reflections of the headlights on the pavement was a needed touch. We also used a fog machine to create the mood and light rays around the headlights. The group was lit with a <a href="http://jcopho.to/bh_profoto_octa5" target="_blank">5-foot Profoto Octabank</a>. Then we had a <a href="http://jcopho.to/bh_profoto_beauty" target="_blank"> Profoto beauty dish</a> lighting the garage door above them with a grid on it. Nothing too crazy. This shot didn&#8217;t call for craziness. Lastly, we had a light inside the garage to give some detail behind the car. </p>
<p>And of course I shot the ad with ole faithful, my <a href="http://jcopho.to/bh5DMKII" target="_blank">Canon 5D Mark II</a> and a <a href="http://jcopho.to/bh_canon_24" target="_blank">Canon 24-70 2.8mm</a> as my lens. Any other questions?</p>
