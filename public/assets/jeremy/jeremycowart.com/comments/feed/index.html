		<description>Lisa is right and said it well. Talent, Skill, knowledge (and experience) builds a photographer. Not just the camera.

Over the years I have heard this rhetoric coming in from several kids who thought the same. And frankly, as one that has been there, I just assumed its immaturity and the lack of understanding what is real art? Seriously some are just not able to comprehend what makes a good image better and what is a &quot;snapshot.&quot;  I&#039;ve done it all, covered foreign nationals, wars, people and so on. All it takes is a connection.  In my day, you went to a school learned the factors that make up a great image, and if you were lucky, you could find an assistant position somewhere in your own city. Now there are literally agencies offering images from I-phones with reasonable image quality.  I went to a Hassleblad conference last month and 3 out of the 6 pro shooters were selling most of the equipment from their studios. It might be true as you noted that being a photographer is the new &quot;rockstar&quot; visual culture. But its not one they can live from.  Personally, I have to say why is it that kids your of your generation try to envision that you are all alike, and &quot;just like you.&quot;  You might be a lover of photography, but you haven&#039;t eaten, slept or pissed pixels or silver bromide like I have the last 35 years. You are of the opinion that a three course meal is a happy meal at McDonalds, and not served at one&#039;s leisure. 

You want it now.... and the &quot;art is gone,&#039; so how can you even think you could be like me or half of the guys before me?</description>

		<description>“How does a little artsy guy like me build a freaking hotel chain???”


&quot;I’ve shared it in limited capacity at conferences, etc. People have wept on the spot when hearing about it. Strangers have emailed me, saying they want to work for this hotel for the rest of their lives. Millionaires have told me they’re ready to invest. “This is what we’ve been looking for”, they say&quot;



In my opinion, you have answered yourself, as we usually do. I suppose it is more of a matter of selection and deployment. There is a step from invention to creation.

I have a friend with many of the traits you see in yourself. He and I can handle the rapid fire, give and take, multi tasking. We drive others crazy or they think of us as rude. I am fifty and have slowed down a little. God bless, I enjoyed and learned from your article.</description>

		<description>the greatest part about it, I think, is the excellence at which you pursue things. You&#039;re not just taking photos, you strive to do it with excellence and &#039;one up&#039; yourself. You don&#039;t just create an app (because who needs another app?!), you do it with excellence that people can&#039;t help but find a way to tell others about it.  Excellence.  that is what sets ordinary ideas, and ordinary people, apart.</description>

		<description>Dude, I get it because I am the same way.  I have more Moleskines and Field Note journals filled with more ideas than I care to count.  I see opportunity everywhere, ideas for companies, brand new products and concepts to improve existing ones. Everyone says I am so creative, but mostly I just feel crazy.  I have found that  getting them out of my head and on to paper helps.  I once created a blog called ConsumableThought.com in the hopes that investors or VC guys would pick up the ideas and run with it but I eventually dumped the site because I want to make these ideas come to life, not someone else!  

My latest projects are ShootLove.com, a site that helps photographers build their businesses by offering interviews and layered PSD files to get them started.  Another is TheLightwriters.org, a non profit that pairs photographers with foster kids in a mentoring program aimed at building relationships and self esteem.  So, yeah, I feel you man.

Keep creating brother, you are making the world a better place to live and you&#039;re inspiring many, including me.

Cheers,
Dustin Bryson</description>
